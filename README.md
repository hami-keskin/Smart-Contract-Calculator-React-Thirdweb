Smart Contract Calculator with React and Thirdweb
This project is a simple calculator built using React and Ethereum smart contracts. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two input numbers.

Requirements
To run this project, you will need:

Node.js (v14 or later)
MetaMask browser extension
An Ethereum wallet with some testnet ETH (e.g. Rinkeby)
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-contract-calculator.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd smart-contract-calculator
Install the dependencies:

Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:

sql
Copy code
npm start
Open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Connect your MetaMask wallet to the Rinkeby testnet.

Enter two numbers in the input fields.

Click one of the four buttons to perform an arithmetic operation on the numbers.

The result of the operation will be displayed on the screen.

Smart Contract
The smart contract used in this project is a simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. It takes two input parameters and returns the result of the operation.

Future Improvements
Add support for more advanced arithmetic operations (e.g. exponents, roots).
Improve the user interface to make it more intuitive and user-friendly.
Add error handling for cases where the user inputs invalid values or the smart contract call fails.
