# Smart Contract Calculator with React and Thirdweb

This is a simple calculator built with React and Thirdweb, which allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations using a smart contract deployed on the Sepolia network.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

MetaMask browser extension
An Ethereum wallet with some testnet ETH (e.g. Sepolia)


### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/hami-keskin/Smart-Contract-Calculator-React-Thirdweb.git


2.Navigate to the project directory:

cd thirdweb-app


3. Install dependencies:

npm install


4. Start the development server:

npm start


5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Usage

1. Connect your wallet to the Sepolia network using the "Connect Wallet" button.
2. Enter the first number in the first input field.
3. Enter the second number in the second input field.
4. Click one of the four buttons to perform the corresponding operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
5. Wait for the result to be displayed.


### Smart Contract
The smart contract used in this project is a simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. It takes two input parameters and returns the result of the operation.

### Future Improvements
1. Add support for more advanced arithmetic operations.
2. Improve the user interface to make it more intuitive and user-friendly.
3. Add error handling for cases where the user inputs invalid values or the smart contract call fails.
